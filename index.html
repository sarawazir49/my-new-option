        <h2>Studing IT</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(33, 12, 151);">  Studying IT was one of my dreams and I always think that dreams come true, especially in IT you can achieve every dream, just start to simplify all the information and step by step you will be on another level, going from a small dream to a worldwide project.
            
           
        </p>
        <p>I want to study this course to renew all the information and get all the new updates in IT world. I have not forgotten everything I have learned but If I want to take a step forward and work in this expansive field I need to get a strong start, improve myself and prove to myself and others that I still can do it and that I’m still that strong woman I've always been.</p>

        <h2>Future developer</h2>
    <p>Every day I’ll be presented with new challenges. I need to know how to figure things out, and if I don’t, I need to learn it on the job. I’m expected to be learning every day and this is awesome as I’m not stagnating in the job market but building up lots of experience as the time passes.</p>
    <p>Being required to learn every day can either be frustrating, or very exciting. It all depends on your mindset. Good developers are in high demand. You might not find a job for a top or famous company, but local companies are desperate to find talent. There’s no shortage of opportunities in the foreseeable future, too. On the contrary, there will likely be more demand for developers in the future, to develop new software or maintain an existing one. Remote working, even for just a few days a week, makes for a good work/life balance. It’s not allowed in all the environments, but remote working is a perk that’s very well suited to software development. Software development is one of the jobs that - depending on your responsibilities and how good you are at your job.</p>
    <p>It’s not painting or design, but programming is a highly creative profession. Any time you set out to write a program you’re creating something new, much like when you were playing Lego as a child. Many times you experiment with technologies, only to find that’s not a good way, so you choose a different path. Every time you write a new program, you learn something new. It’s never boring unless your job is boring in the first place, but the craft of programming in itself should not be boring - otherwise you always have the option to look for a non-boring job. Even if one might spend 10 hours a day sitting alone with a computer, saying programming is social is perfectly right.

    <h2>Who is Sara?</h2>
    <p class="sara-info">My name is Sara Al Wazir and I'm a 36 years old woman from Lebanon. I came to Sweden in 2013 to start my new life and to build a family here in Sweden. Now I'm a proud mom of three children :)</p>
    <p class="study-info">I finished my University studies in ICT” Information Communication Technologies" from the Arab Open University in 2012, but I have not worked in that profession so I have no professional experience in that field and I'm pretty sure a lot has changed in that field since then.</p>
    <p>I got married in 2013 then I traveled to Sweden to live with my husband "Ahmad" and from the very beginning I began to search for a job, but I got no chance to work in what I have trained for at the university, so I worked first for a year as an assistant in a nursing home and then I worked for two and a half years as a teaching assistant for Arab teenagers who have fled the war and destruction and came to Sweden from countries such as Syria and Iraq.</p>
    <p>Later I became pregnant and had my first child, a girl, and took parental leave. A whole new life began when I had my first daughter Rima, then I had another daughter who was named Dima and now the latest addition to the family: Adam. But now I feel that I want to improve myself and invest as much as I can of my time to educate myself and get a good starting point and increased chances of getting a job when I enter the labor market again after finishing my studies. When I saw the course you provide I was very happy when I saw the course you provide and decided immediately to apply for it and take the opportunity to study online!</p>
